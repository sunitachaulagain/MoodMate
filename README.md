# 🌙 MoodMate – A Mood-Based Journal with AI Quotes

**MoodMate** is a mood-based journal web app built with **Django**.  
It allows users to record their daily mood and short notes — and in return, it displays a comforting or motivational quote that matches their mood 💬

This project is part of my **7-day Django learning challenge**, where I build and polish one complete app step by step.
